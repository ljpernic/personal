        "description": "Haven Spec Magazine is a speculative fiction magazine featuring stories for a 21st century audience. We love stories with a sense of adventure, stories that teach us, that touch us, that leave us wanting more. We publish six issues every year, two of which (the DRY ISSUE and the WET ISSUE) are focused exclusively on the climate crisis and themes of displacement (very broadly defined).",
